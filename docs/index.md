        Hi there! I am currently a Master's Student in <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/masters/degrees/meng">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> with a concentration in software development at <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University </a>. I graduated from Zhejiang University (ZJU) and the University of Edinburgh (UoE) in June 2022. I received dual bachelor's degrees in Biomedical Sciences from both ZJU and UoE. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also an enthusiastic self-learner and interested in various fields of computer science. Here are my [course notes] for all the courses that I have taken where I share my self-learning experiences and resources. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For future career interests, I am particularly interested in software engineering and AI for science, especially Biology.
      </p>
