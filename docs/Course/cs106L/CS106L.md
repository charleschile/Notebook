### About

为什么要学CS106L？24年国庆节之后入职的实习需要使用到C++和C#，想要趁着国庆假期将斯坦福的CS106B以及CS106L都学习一下。

### lecture1 welcome

CS106L focus on code: what makes it good, what powerful and elegant code looks like.

Only STL.

understand how and why C++ was made.

C language: no objects or classes, difficult to write generic code

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroutstrup in 1983



Design philosophy of C++:

1. only add features if they solve an actual problem
2. programmers should be free to choose their own sytle
3. compartmentalization is key
4. Allow the programmer full control of if they want it
5. don't sacrifice performance except as a last resort
6. enforce safety at compile time whenever possible



### lecture2 types and structs

`using namespace std;` is not good style

STL - standard template library

Namespace for the STL is std



C++ fundamental types:

```cpp
#include <string>
int val = 5; //32 bits
char ch = 'F'; //8 bits (usually)
float decimalVal1 = 5.0; //32 bits (usually)
double decimalVal2 = 5.0; //64 bits (usually)
bool bVal = true; //1 bit
std::string str = "sarah";
```



C++ is a statically typed language, everything with a name(variables, functions, etc) is given a type before runtime

dynamically typed: everything with a name is given a type at runtim based on the thing's current value

If the type is wrong, Python crash during runtime, but C++ compile error and the code will never run
