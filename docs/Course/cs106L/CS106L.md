### About

为什么要学CS106L？24年国庆节之后入职的实习需要使用到C++和C#，想要趁着国庆假期将斯坦福的CS106B以及CS106L都学习一下。

### lecture1 welcome

CS106L focus on code: what makes it good, what powerful and elegant code looks like.

Only STL.

understand how and why C++ was made.

C language: no objects or classes, difficult to write generic code

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroutstrup in 1983



Design philosophy of C++:

1. only add features if they solve an actual problem
2. programmers should be free to choose their own sytle
3. compartmentalization is key
4. Allow the programmer full control of if they want it
5. don't sacrifice performance except as a last resort
6. enforce safety at compile time whenever possible



### lecture2 types and structs

`using namespace std;` is not good style

STL - standard template library

Namespace for the STL is std



#### 2.1 types

C++ fundamental types:

```cpp
#include <string>
int val = 5; //32 bits
char ch = 'F'; //8 bits (usually)
float decimalVal1 = 5.0; //32 bits (usually)
double decimalVal2 = 5.0; //64 bits (usually)
bool bVal = true; //1 bit
std::string str = "sarah";
```



C++ is a statically typed language, everything with a name(variables, functions, etc) is given a type before runtime

dynamically typed: everything with a name is given a type at runtim based on the thing's current value






![compile vs interpreted](../../pics/compile%20vs%20interpreted.png)



If the type is wrong, Python crash during runtime, but C++ compile error and the code will never run

#### 2.2 overloading

overloading: defien two functions with the same name but different types.

```cpp
int half(int x, int divisor = 2) {
  return x / divisor;
}
double half(double x) { 
  return x / 2;
}

half(4) // uses version (1), returns 2
half(3, 3) // uses version (1), returns 1
half(3.0) // uses version (2), returns 1.5
```



#### 2.3 structs

Two methods of initializing a struct.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
struct Student {
    std::string name;
    std::string state;
    int age;
};

void printStudentInfo(Student s) {
    std::cout << s.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << s.state << std::endl;
    std::cout << s.age << std:: endl; 
}

int main () {
    Student s1;
    s1.name = "Charles";
    s1.state = "Zhejiang";
    s1.age = 24;
    printStudentInfo(s1);

    Student s2 = {"Chi Le", "Suzhou", 22};
    printStudentInfo(s2);
}
```



#### 2.4 std::pair

`std::pair` is an STL build-in struct with two fields of any type.

`std::pair` is a **template**, you specify the types of the fields inside <> for each pair object you make

The fields in `std::pair` s are named **first** and **second**
