# Programming Fundamentals 

## Module 1 Introduction

learn how to approach a programming problem methodically

### 1. How to write a program with the seven steps

#### Programming: plan first, then code

1. 30 minutes planning could save hours of trying to make the code work properly. Well planned code is not only more likely to be correct (or at least closer to correct), but is also easier to understandâ€”and thus fix.
2. the heart of programming is to figure out how to solve a class of problems
3. account for all possible legal values of the parameters and first figure out the algorithm for this class of problems

#### Overview of the seven steps

Step 1-4: devise algorithms

Step 5: translate to code

Step 6: test program

Step 7: debug program
